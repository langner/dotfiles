#
# This is the GTK+ RC file for gentoo. The first (rudimentary)
# GTK+ RC support was added in version 0.9.15.
#
# Currently named widgets are:
# "mainPane{0,1}"	The CLists in the panes.
# "cstPreview"		The preview CList in style config.
# "txvText"		The Text widget used for viewing
#			text (output capture, ViewText & ViewHex cmds).
#
# Other widgets must be accessed by their class names.
#
# For information about how to write GTK+ RC files, see the
# official GTK+ tutorial (doubtlessly available from www.gtk.org).
#

# Syntax according to tutorial:
#
# style <name> [= <name>]
# {
#   <option>
# }
#
# widget <widget_set> style <style_name>
# widget_class <widget_class_set> style <style_name>
