# A script to mount/unmount a private encrypted directory.
# Checks first whether the mount point is already mounted.
# Mount -- when 'on' is in the command line.
# Unmount -- when 'off' is in the command line.

# Assume the encrypted and decrypted directories have been set,
#   or set them here below.
# ECRYPTFS_ENCRYPTED=/home/me/dir/encrypted
# ECRYPTFS_DECRYPTED=/home/me/dir/decrypted
